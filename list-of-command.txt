In powershell to get ssh to the box:

shh -i "name of the saved private key file" "public address of the ec2 instance
ssh -i "test_key_ssh.pem" ubuntu@ec2-18-222-233-151.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com


once ssh into the linux box:

1) sudo apt-get update

Updates all the packages inside 

2) sudo apt-get install awscli

Install the aws cli

2a) aws configure

I didn't have it setup right, so I had to configure it with my info.
When I have IAM right I don't think I will have to do this

3) aws s3 ls

Look at the all the s3 buckets it has access to

4)  aws s3 ls s3://challenge-private-bucket

based on the bucket name, list out all the files inside of it. 

5)  aws s3 cp s3://challenge-private-bucket/test-file-to-upload.txt my-file.txt

Copy the file to this machine

6) cat my-file.txt

Read the file


Need to be able to set this as a directory to go to each time:
/mnt/c/K8sPlayground/AWS-Practice/VM
cd /mnt/c/K8sPlayground/AWS-Practice/VM/real-world/database
